# AI Automation Workflow for Digital Media Agency

## üìù Project Overview

This repository showcases an AI-powered automation workflow designed for a digital media agency. It contains Jupyter notebooks demonstrating solutions for **content management**, **security monitoring**, and **image processing**. The primary objective is to leverage deep learning to automate key operational tasks, drastically reducing manual effort and improving efficiency. The implementation of this workflow resulted in a **70% reduction in operational costs** and a **180% increase in productivity**.

## üìä System Components & Methodology

The project is built on three core systems, each addressing a specific challenge within the digital media workflow.

### **Content Management System**

  * **Objective**: To automate the summarization and analysis of articles, reducing manual content processing time.
  * **Methodology**: The system uses **BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformer)** and **Gemini** models for advanced Natural Language Processing. These models are fine-tuned for abstractive summarization and content analysis, cutting down article processing time by **85%**.

### **Security Monitoring System**

  * **Objective**: To provide real-time, automated security surveillance and attendance tracking.
  * **Methodology**: This component is powered by the **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8)** model. It excels at real-time object detection and tracking, enabling continuous monitoring and instant alerts. The system successfully enhanced security coverage to **98%** and reduced security incidents by **75%**.

### **Image Processing Pipeline**

  * **Objective**: To automate the tedious process of image enhancement and captioning.
  * **Methodology**: A hybrid architecture combining a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for feature extraction and a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for contextual understanding is used. This pipeline generates accurate, context-aware image captions with **85% accuracy** and accelerates image processing from 30 minutes to just **3 seconds** per image.
