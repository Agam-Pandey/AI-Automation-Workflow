      " Delhi's 24-hour average air quality recorded at 4 pm Thursday was 424 AQI, in the ‘severe’ category, slightly worse than 418 AQI reported Wednesday. Emergency response measures such as discontinuing physical classes for primary school students in entire Delhi-NCR have been ordered. A ban will kick in for running BS III petrol and BS IV diesel-operated four-wheelers in Delhi and the districts of Gurgaon, Faridabad, Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar. All highly dust-generating construction and demolition activities will be banned. AQI of Delhi started improving late night, which saw an episodic hike in AQI yesterday. However, it remained stagnant since morning today and was hovering around the 425 mark. Forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology indicated the likelihood of the AQI to remain in the higher end of the ‘Very Poor’ category. Dense fog is likely to prevail late night and early morning over northwest India for the next 2-3 days. According to Flightradar24, an online portal that tracks flights around the world, 447 flights were delayed in departure and 239 flights delayed in arrival.\n"
